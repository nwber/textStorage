# textStorage

nodejs app. takes text and stores it. uses express and sqlite

doesn't handle errors that well tbh

disclaimer: if you don't like my code, that's ok. email me `nick` at `bergeron` dot `com` with lots of dollar signs and I'll fix it. if you're broke, stop reading now and close your browser. go outside and think about your actions. you're really gonna be mad and broke?
